Main pseudo-code:

while (true) {

	Thread each sub routine, using mutual exclusion to
	stop two or more sub-routines from accessing the 
	rotors at the same time.

	Sub-routines (as of now) includes balance (default daemon), 
	and command daemon (left, right, up, down).

	Command daemon will incorporate self-balancing
	so as to keep the drone from falling while idle.

	Exception handling will, worst case, call landing().

	Master thread is remote control for prototype,
	sends information to all other sub-routines.

}
